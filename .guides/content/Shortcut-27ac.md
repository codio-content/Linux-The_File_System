## Commands are getting longer

What if I need to place my cursor at the beginning of the line, lets say for correcting a typo or adding a command option?

### Position the cursor at the beginning of the line

Whenever you are typing a long command, type the `ctrl + a` keyboard shortcut to place the prompt cursor at the beginning of the command line:

### Position the cursor at the end of the line

In the other hand, the `ctrl + e` keyboard shortcut would do the opposite placing the cursor at the end of the line:
