## Simplifying our web project directory structure

In the last unit, our `~/workspace` directory was left with the following structure:

```
~/workspace
-- assets
--- img
---- logo.png
-- css
--- styles.css
-- test-website
--- img
---- logo.png
--- index.html
--- .website-config
index.html
```

In this unit we are going to focus on moving and copying files and directories to our _test-website_ directory and cover some CLI productivity tricks.

__Almost all application development frameworks for any device rely heavily on their file hierarchy to organize code__.
