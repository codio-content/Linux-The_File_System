## Managing the file system like a pro

Well, almost like a pro, we are missing file and directory permissions which we are going to cover on the next unit, but for now:

1. You can combine your relative and absolute paths knowledge together with the `mv` command to move or rename files and directories across the entire file system
2. The same for the `cp` command for copying files, directories and its content
3. You've learned super effective keyboard shortcuts that increase your CLI productivity
4. You can `cd` the file system on all its levels
